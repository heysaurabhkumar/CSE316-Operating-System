Deadlock Detection and Recovery

The Problem 

Write a program to implement deadlock detection algorithm with multiple resources of each type. Your program read from file the following inputs: the number of processes, the number of resource type, the number of resource of each type in existence (Vector E), the current allocation matrix C, so request matrix R. The output of your should indicate if there is a deadlock in the system or not. In case there is deadlock in the system, the program should print the identifies of all processes that are deadlock. Also recover the process from deadlock condition.
